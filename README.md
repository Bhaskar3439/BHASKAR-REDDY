The "Design and Implementation of Low Power Decoder using GDI Technology in 90nm" project focuses on creating a decoder circuit with minimal power consumption, leveraging Gate Diffusion Input (GDI) technology. GDI is a low-power digital circuit design technique that reduces power and area while enhancing performance.

Key Aspects of the Project:
Technology: The circuit is implemented in 90nm CMOS technology, which is commonly used for low-power and high-performance applications.

GDI Technique: GDI is employed to minimize power consumption by reducing the number of transistors needed for basic logic gates, leading to less switching activity and lower leakage currents.

Decoder Functionality: A decoder translates encoded inputs into a unique output. For example, in a 2-to-4 line decoder, 2 inputs will produce 4 unique outputs, each corresponding to a specific input combination.

Design Optimization: The project aims to optimize parameters like delay, power dissipation, and area of the decoder by using GDI compared to traditional CMOS design techniques.

Applications: Such low-power decoders are highly useful in memory addressing, communication systems, and microprocessor circuits, where power efficiency is crucial for overall system performance.

This project demonstrates a method to reduce power consumption significantly without sacrificing the performance of digital circuits, making it a valuable contribution to energy-efficient circuit design.
